# Mp3 Crawler

## Abstract

This is just a simple jupyter notebook designed to crawl through my local mp3 collection that I accumulated during the early 2000's. It then outputs a .csv table that can then be used to transfer music to a modern streaming service.

## Notes

A few of these tracks I can't find online since they predate the age of music streaming.  Since then, alot of these artists have either died or went on to do other things and their music never got the chance to get online in a meaningful way. A smaller percentage exist on other services like Bandcamp and Soundcloud.  

Sigh, one day I hope to have all my music centralized in a single location...
